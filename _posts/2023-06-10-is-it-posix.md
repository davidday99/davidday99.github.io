title:  "Is it POSIX?"
---

Sometimes I hear the phrase, "Is it Posix?" referring to whether some OS feature or program is 
POSIX-compliant. The first time I heard it was in college. At that time, I had never even 
heard of POSIX.

Later I came across some Stack Overflow answers 
[here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11983/what-exactly-is-posix/11996#11996) and
[here](https://superuser.com/questions/322601/what-does-it-mean-to-have-a-posix-compliant-operating-system)
that I thought were really helpful in explaining what POSIX is and what it means for software to be POSIX-compliant. 
The first one is especially thorough.

You're probably already writing POSIX-compliant software whether you realize it or not; if you're considering portability
and how to make your software usable across systems. "Does the shell have `cd` (like pretty much every shell except Windows command prompt)?" 
"Is this system call available in all Unix-like operating systems?" Well there's a phrase for that.

So, is it POSIX?
