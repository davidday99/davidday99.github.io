Hi! I'm David Day. I'm a software engineer living in Austin, Texas. I enjoy low-level systems programming, especially the kind related to operating system kernels and network protocols. I'm also interested in computer architecture and organization.

Right now I'm learning about PCB layout with the intention of building some custom single-board computers. The idea of building and programming a computer system from scratch is really exciting! This is somewhat of a longer term goal, but check out my <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page to view my first ever manufactured PCB. It's really basic, but it's a start!
