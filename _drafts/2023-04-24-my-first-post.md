title:  "My First Post!"

Hello, world! This is my very first post on my very first personal site. I've been wanting to set up a website for years now but never found the time. I've played around with tools like React and Vue, but they seemed so heavy-duty for the simple kind of site I wanted--a place where I could simply display projects and make blog posts. 

I recently came across Jekyll, the static site generator geared toward blog sites. After learning a bit about it and trying it out, I was hooked. It has all the capabilites I need for my static website, a high degree of configurability, and the convenience of markdown support for clean looking formatting off the bat. I checked out a few public templates which looked great, but I ultimately settled on the default template for its simplicity. Maybe in the future I'll look into some more advanced layouts, but for now this is really all I need.

Anyway, I finally have my site set up; although it's still very much a work in progress. I'm planning on adding a list of past and present projects. I'll be creating posts now and then, too--whenever I get the urge to do some writing. 

I'm looking forward to adding stuff in the coming weeks. Until next time!
